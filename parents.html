<p></i><font color="#00008B">Miss Chase: </font color="#00008B"> Good evening everybody. As I explained to you on the phone, this is the headmasters idea, to give you the opportunity to see what a typical day may be like for your children in my class. I am not so sure myself if it is a good idea but we shall see. The first thing we do each day is to call out the register, so let' start with that. ( a short pause). Ronnie?<p>
<font color="#00008B">Ronnie:</font color="#00008B"> Yes?<p>
<font color="#00008B">Miss Chase:</font color="#00008B">  Ok let me explain. When I call out your name you should say present, not yes.<p>
<font color="#00008B">Ronnie: </font color="#00008B"> Oh I see, Sorry<p>
<font color="#00008B">Miss Chase: </font color="#00008B"> Not to worry, let's try again. Ronnie?<p>
<font color="#00008B">Ronnie:</font color="#00008B">  Present<p>
<font color="#00008B">Miss Chase: </font color="#00008B"> Jamie?<p>
<font color="#00008B">Jamie: </font color="#00008B"> Present miss<p>
<font color="#00008B">Miss Chase: </font color="#00008B"> You don't need to be quite so formal Jamie, just present will do<p>
<font color="#00008B">Jamie: </font color="#00008B"> Sorry, was just trying to get into character. - Present<p>
<font color="#00008B">Miss Chase:</font color="#00008B">  Jean?<p>
<font color="#00008B">Jean: </font color="#00008B"> Present<p>
<font color="#00008B">Miss Chase: </font color="#00008B"> Julia?<p>
<font color="#00008B">Ann: </font color="#00008B"> Absent<p>
<font color="#00008B">Miss Chase: </font color="#00008B"> You can't be absent. If you answered. You must be present<p>
<font color="#00008B">Ann:</font color="#00008B">  Oh but I am present. It is Julia who is absent<p>
<font color="#00008B">Miss Chase:</font color="#00008B">  So you are not Julia<p>
<font color="#00008B">Ann: </font color="#00008B"> No, I can't be if she is absent can I? I am Ann. Julia is my neighbour and she couldn't make it this evening.<p>
<font color="#00008B">Miss Chase:</font color="#00008B">  I see. Ok then Ann?<p>
<font color="#00008B">Ann:</font color="#00008B">  Present<p>
<font color="#00008B">Miss Chase: </font color="#00008B"> Heather<p>
<font color="#00008B">Heather: </font color="#00008B"> Present<p>
<font color="#00008B">Miss Chase. </font color="#00008B"> That is the register over then. Firstly we are going to start with a short maths test<p>
<font color="#00008B">Ronnie:</font color="#00008B">  MATHS!!! I hate maths it was always my worst subject at school<p>
<font color="#00008B">Miss Chase:</font color="#00008B">  I would not let the children speak like that in class Ronnie, so please behave like we would expect our children to<p>
<font color="#00008B">Jamie:</font color="#00008B">  I didn't realise we would actually do lessons, I thought it was just to look around the classroom, something like that<p>
<font color="#00008B">Miss Chase:</font color="#00008B">  This is the way the headmaster wants it so this is the way we should try it<p>
<font color="#00008B">Jean:</font color="#00008B">  I am going to be hopeless at this<p>
<font color="#00008B">Ann:</font color="#00008B">  Me too. I am not surprised that Julia didn't want to come.<p>
<font color="#00008B">Heather: </font color="#00008B"> Please may I be excused Miss Chase?<p>
<font color="#00008B">Miss Chase:</font color="#00008B">  Excused?<p>
<font color="#00008B">Heather: </font color="#00008B"> Yes I need to Pe... err sorry, go to the toilet<p>
<font color="#00008B">Miss Chase:</font color="#00008B">  But you only just got here<p>
<font color="#00008B">Heather:</font color="#00008B">  I know, sorry. I am pregnant<p>
<font color="#00008B">Ronnie: </font color="#00008B"> This really is like being in school then<p>
<font color="#00008B">Miss Chase: </font color="#00008B"> Enough of that Ronnie. And yes Heather, You may be excused<p>
<font color="#00008B">Heather: </font color="#00008B"> Thank you<p>
<font color="#00008B">Miss Chase: </font color="#00008B"> Now, If you would all like to take out your pencils.<p>
<font color="#00008B">Jamie: </font color="#00008B"> Sorry Miss Chase I ain't got a pencil<p>
<font color="#00008B">Miss Chase: </font color="#00008B"> Jamie, we do not say I ain't got a pencil. It is not good grammar.  -  I have no pencil, they have no pencils, we have no pencils<p>
<font color="#00008B">Jamie:</font color="#00008B">  Who's got all the pencils then?<p>
<font color="#00008B">Miss Chase: </font color="#00008B"> Oh I can see this being a disaster, you'd better have one of mine<p>
<font color="#00008B">Jamie: </font color="#00008B"> Thank you<p>
<font color="#00008B">Jean: </font color="#00008B"> I haven't got a pencil either â€“ I mean, I have no pencil<p>
<font color="#00008B">Miss Chase:</font color="#00008B">  Did anyone bring a pencil?<p>
<font color="#00008B">Anne: </font color="#00008B"> I didn't. I didn't know we had to<p>
<font color="#00008B">Miss Chase:</font color="#00008B">  I did put it in the note I gave to your children<p>
<font color="#00008B">Ronnie: </font color="#00008B"> My lad never gives me the notes he gets from school<p>
<font color="#00008B">Jamie:</font color="#00008B">  Nor does mine<p>
<font color="#00008B">Miss Chance. </font color="#00008B"> Hmm. That explains a lot<p>
<font color="#00008B">Heather:</font color="#00008B">  I'm back. Sorry about that. Have I missed anything?<p>
<font color="#00008B">Jean:</font color="#00008B">  Just a discussion about pencils. Did you bring one?<p>
<font color="#00008B">Heather: </font color="#00008B"> No, I didn't realise we had to<p>
<font color="#00008B">Ann:</font color="#00008B">  Nor did anyone else<p>
<font color="#00008B">Miss Chase: </font color="#00008B"> So, none of you have pencils. You can all have one of mine each<p>
<font color="#00008B">Heather: </font color="#00008B"> Can I pass them around? I always wanted to be the Pencil Monitor<p>
<font color="#00008B">Miss Chase: </font color="#00008B"> If it pleases you, here they are<p>
<font color="#00008B">Heather:</font color="#00008B">  Yay! I'm the Pencil Monitor<p>
<font color="#00008B">Miss Chase: </font color="#00008B"> As there has been some opposition to doing a maths test maybe it will be easier if we just do some general knowledge<p>
<font color="#00008B">Ronnie:</font color="#00008B">  You mean like a pub quiz?<p>
<font color="#00008B">Miss Chase: </font color="#00008B"> Very similar I suppose<p>
<font color="#00008B">Jamie: </font color="#00008B"> Are we going to be in teams then?<p>
<font color="#00008B">Miss Chase: </font color="#00008B"> No, it is not that much like a pub quiz<p>
<font color="#00008B">Ronnie:</font color="#00008B">  I hope there are some sports questions. I always do well on those at the pub<p>
<font color="#00008B">Miss chase:</font color="#00008B">  I am afraid no sports questions<p>
<font color="#00008B">Jean: </font color="#00008B"> Good! I know nothing about sport<p>
<font color="#00008B">Miss chase:</font color="#00008B">  So would you please write your name on top of the paper<p>
<font color="#00008B">Ann:</font color="#00008B">  What paper?<p>
<font color="#00008B">Miss Chase:</font color="#00008B">  Did none of you bring paper either? Actually, don't bother answering that, I will get you some, and no, we don't need a paper monitor<p>
<font color="#00008B">Heather: </font color="#00008B"> I feel guilty that we didn't bring the right things<p>
<font color="#00008B">Miss Chase: </font color="#00008B"> Not to worry, here, one sheet each<p>
<font color="#00008B">Everyone: </font color="#00008B"> Thank you<p>
<font color="#00008B">Miss Chase: </font color="#00008B"> So, as I said, name at the top please<p>
<font color="#00008B">Ronnie: </font color="#00008B"> Oooops. Sorry Miss Chase I have just broken the pencil lead, do you have a sharpener?<p>
<font color="#00008B">Jamie: </font color="#00008B"> Ohh, just broken mine too<p>
<font color="#00008B">Miss Chase: </font color="#00008B"> ( a big sigh) It seems the pencils and paper may not be such a good idea after all. I will just ask the questions and you can tell me the answer<p>
<font color="#00008B">Ann: </font color="#00008B"> That's a good idea<p>
<font color="#00008B">Heather: </font color="#00008B"> Yes. My writing is a bit illegible anyway<p>
<font color="#00008B">Miss Chase: </font color="#00008B"> First question. Where is The Forth Bridge?<p>
<font color="#00008B">Ronnie: </font color="#00008B"> Just after the third one (laughter)<p>
<font color="#00008B">Miss Chase: </font color="#00008B"> That is not funny Ronnie. And before you answer you need to put your hand up<p>
<font color="#00008B">Jamie:</font color="#00008B">  I know Miss Chase. <p>
<font color="#00008B">Miss Chase:</font color="#00008B">  Ok Jamie, thank you for putting up you hand. Where is it?<p>
<font color="#00008B">Jamie: </font color="#00008B"> Scotland<p>
<font color="#00008B">Miss Chase:</font color="#00008B">  Correct. Second question. What is the capital of Australia?<p>
<font color="#00008B">Jean: </font color="#00008B"> Please miss, is it Sydney?<p>
<font color="#00008B">Ann: </font color="#00008B"> No definitely not Sydney<p>
<font color="#00008B">Miss Chase:</font color="#00008B">  I will do the marking thank you Ann<p>
<font color="#00008B">Ann:</font color="#00008B">  I didn't mark it. I was just saying<p>
<font color="#00008B">Heather: </font color="#00008B"> She couldn't mark it anyway, she hasn't got a pencil<p>
<font color="#00008B">Miss Chase:</font color="#00008B">  So does anyone know the capital of Australia<p>
<font color="#00008B">Ronnie: </font color="#00008B"> A<p>
<font color="#00008B">Miss Chase:</font color="#00008B">  It is not polite to say 'A' Ronnie. You should say something like, I beg your pardon if you didn't hear<p>
<font color="#00008B">Ronnie:</font color="#00008B">  But I did hear.<p>
<font color="#00008B"> Miss Chase: </font color="#00008B"> So why did you say 'A'?<p>
<font color="#00008B">Jamie: </font color="#00008B"> I know why. Because A is the capital letter of Australia<p>
<font color="#00008B">Jean: </font color="#00008B"> You should have said - what is the capital city Miss<p>
<font color="#00008B">Miss Chase:</font color="#00008B">  Ohh we all think we are so very clever don't we? Alright then, what is the capital CITY of Australia<p>
<font color="#00008B">Ann: </font color="#00008B"> It is Canberra Miss<p>
<font color="#00008B"> Miss Chase: </font color="#00008B"> Correct<p>
<font color="#00008B">Ann:</font color="#00008B">  Do I get a gold star?<p>
<font color="#00008B">Miss chase:</font color="#00008B">  Not for answering one question correctly. One more question: What year was the United Nations established? <p>
<font color="#00008B">Heather: </font color="#00008B"> Way before I was born. How are we supposed to know that?<p>
<font color="#00008B">Miss Chase: </font color="#00008B"> Romeo And Juliet was written before I was born but I still know it was written by Shakespeare<p>
<font color="#00008B">Ronnie: </font color="#00008B"> I think I know<p>
<font color="#00008B">Miss Chase:</font color="#00008B">  What is your answer Ronnie?<p>
<font color="#00008B">Ronnie: </font color="#00008B"> 1945<p>
<font color="#00008B">Miss Chase: </font color="#00008B"> Correct. (short pause). I think it is time we tried something else now.<p>
<font color="#00008B">Jamie:</font color="#00008B">  I'd be happy to try anything else<p>
<font color="#00008B">Jean: </font color="#00008B"> How about an art lesson? I love to draw<p>
<font color="#00008B">Miss Chase: </font color="#00008B"> An art lesson would take too long to set up and I don't want to keep you here too late.<p>
<font color="#00008B">Ann:</font color="#00008B">  I only have a babysitter for another hour or so<p>
<font color="#00008B">Heather:</font color="#00008B">  My husband is looking after our kids so there will be a big mess to clear up when I get home<p>
<font color="#00008B">Ronnie:</font color="#00008B">  I am going straight to the pub from here<p>
<font color="#00008B">Jamie:</font color="#00008B">  Me too<p>
<font color="#00008B">Miss Chase:</font color="#00008B">  Well it isn't quite home time yet, so let's try another lesson<p>
<font color="#00008B">Jean:</font color="#00008B">  What's it going to be this time?<p>
<font color="#00008B">Miss Chase:</font color="#00008B">  One of my personal favourites<p>
<font color="#00008B">Ann:</font color="#00008B">  Lets hope it is also one of ours<p>
<font color="#00008B">Heather:</font color="#00008B">  Anything but sport!<p>
<font color="#00008B">Miss Chase:</font color="#00008B">  This lesson is called debate<p>
<font color="#00008B">Ronnie: </font color="#00008B"> The bait? Are we going fishing then<p>
<font color="#00008B">Miss Chase:</font color="#00008B">  I did not say The Bait, I said debate<p>
<font color="#00008B">Jamie: </font color="#00008B"> What's that then?<p>
<font color="#00008B">Miss Chase: </font color="#00008B"> I give the children a subject and they discuss the pros and cons of that subject. Some will be on one side, some will be on the other.<p>
<font color="#00008B">Jean:</font color="#00008B">  Like an argument then?<p>
<font color="#00008B">Ann: </font color="#00008B"> If you need a lesson on argument just ask my husband<p>
<font color="#00008B">Heather: </font color="#00008B"> Or mine<p>
<font color="#00008B">Miss Chase: </font color="#00008B"> It isn't really an argument, more of a discussion.<p>
<font color="#00008B">Ronnie: </font color="#00008B"> I prefer the sound of that to maths<p>
<font color="#00008B">Miss Chase:</font color="#00008B">  Very well. Let's try it and we will see which sides people take<p>
<font color="#00008B">Ronnie: </font color="#00008B"> So what is the subject?<p>
<font color="#00008B">Miss Chase: </font color="#00008B"> Let me think<p>
<font color="#00008B">Jamie:</font color="#00008B">  Don't make it too difficult<p>
<font color="#00008B">Miss Chase: </font color="#00008B"> I will try not too<p>
<font color="#00008B">Jean:</font color="#00008B">  If my husband were here he would argue about anything<p>
<font color="#00008B">Miss Chase:</font color="#00008B">  As I said before, it is not really an argument but a debate. So the subject is this. What kind of movie do you prefer? Animation or with real actors?<p>
<font color="#00008B">Ann: </font color="#00008B"> Interesting subject<p>
<font color="#00008B">Miss Chase: </font color="#00008B"> I am glad you think so. In that case, let's start with you Ann. What is your opinion<p>
<font color="#00008B">Ann: </font color="#00008B"> I definitely prefer films with real actors. I do watch animations with the kids but I find them boring<p>
<font color="#00008B">Heather: </font color="#00008B"> I'm the same. The kids love them but they make me go to sleep<p>
<font color="#00008B">Ronnie:</font color="#00008B">  I don't think I have ever watched an animated film all the way through. I prefer a good action movie or crime thriller<p>
<font color="#00008B">Jamie: </font color="#00008B"> With plenty of car chases. You don't get excitement like that from watching cartoons<p>
<font color="#00008B">Miss Chase:</font color="#00008B">  So it seems none of you actually prefer animations which doesn't make much of a debate<p>
<font color="#00008B">Jean: </font color="#00008B"> Sorry about that but we can only say what we feel<p>
<font color="#00008B">Ann: </font color="#00008B"> That's true<p>
<font color="#00008B">Heather: </font color="#00008B"> I can pretend to like animations if that helps?<p>
<font color="#00008B">Miss Chase:</font color="#00008B">  Not really. There would really wouldn't be any conviction<p>
<font color="#00008B">Ronnie:</font color="#00008B">  How about another subject then?<p>
<font color="#00008B">Jamie: </font color="#00008B"> Like Liverpool or Everton?<p>
<font color="#00008B">Heather:</font color="#00008B">  No sport<p>
<font color="#00008B">Ronnie: </font color="#00008B"> What subject would you choose then Heather?<p>
<font color="#00008B">Heather: </font color="#00008B"> With three kids to bring up and also working I must admit that I find it hard to have any other interests<p>
<font color="#00008B">Jean: </font color="#00008B"> I agree with that, it's the same for me<p>
<font color="#00008B">Ronnie: </font color="#00008B"> You must have some other interests? For me it is football, and of course, pub quizzes<p>
<font color="#00008B">Ann: </font color="#00008B"> But you are a man, and it is different for men<p>
<font color="#00008B">Ronnie: </font color="#00008B"> I don't see why<p>
<font color="#00008B">Heather:</font color="#00008B">  Exactly! You just don't understand how different it is<p>
<font color="#00008B">Jean: </font color="#00008B"> May I ask you a question Miss Chase?<p>
<font color="#00008B">Miss Chase:</font color="#00008B">  Of course, please do <p>
<font color="#00008B">Jean:</font color="#00008B">  Is it difficult to keep control of the children these days?<p>
<font color="#00008B">Jamie: </font color="#00008B"> When I was at school we got the cane if we misbehaved<p>
<font color="#00008B">Miss Chase:</font color="#00008B">  Of course that doesn't happen any more, not for a long time<p>
<font color="#00008B">Ronnie: </font color="#00008B"> Maybe it should. It didn't do me any harm<p>
<font color="#00008B">Jean: </font color="#00008B"> Are you sure about that?<p>
<font color="#00008B">Ronnie: </font color="#00008B"> Of course<p>
<font color="#00008B">Ann: </font color="#00008B"> It was wrong, so very wrong and I am glad it was stopped<p>
<font color="#00008B">Jamie:</font color="#00008B">  Not everyone agrees with you<p>
<font color="#00008B">Ann:</font color="#00008B">  I know that but it is definitely how I feel<p>
<font color="#00008B">Heather:</font color="#00008B">  It was barbarous and no way to treat children<p>
<font color="#00008B">Ronnie: </font color="#00008B"> Barbarous is a bit strong. A quick flick on the bottom with a cane is hardly barbarous<p>
<font color="#00008B">Jean: </font color="#00008B"> So how would you feel if you did something wrong at work and rather than a telling off you got caned?<p>
<font color="#00008B">Jamie: </font color="#00008B"> That's different, we are adults now.<p>
<font color="#00008B">Ronnie: </font color="#00008B"> And to be caned at work would be humiliating<p>
<font color="#00008B">Jean:</font color="#00008B">  Exactly. So are you saying it is humiliating for adults but not for children?<p>
<font color="#00008B">Ann: </font color="#00008B"> Don't you see? It could be just as humiliating for a child<p>
<font color="#00008B">Heather:</font color="#00008B">  And isn't it teaching them that violence is an answer?<p>
<font color="#00008B">Jamie:</font color="#00008B">  Violence is like a â€“ well, riot or something, not the cane at school<p>
<font color="#00008B">Ronnie:</font color="#00008B">  Agreed I don't think we can compare the two<p>
<font color="#00008B">Jean:</font color="#00008B">  I think that is exactly what we can do. It involves someone being hurt and that is not right<p>
<font color="#00008B">Ann: </font color="#00008B"> If caning were still allowed in schools today I would teach my kids at home<p>
<font color="#00008B">Heather:</font color="#00008B">  So would I. And I would campaign to ban it<p>
<font color="#00008B">Ronnie: </font color="#00008B"> Well if my kid did something wrong I would expect him to be punished<p>
<font color="#00008B">Jamie: </font color="#00008B"> Otherwise they never learn<p>
<font color="#00008B">Jean: </font color="#00008B"> Punish them yes, but not with physical pain<p>
<font color="#00008B">Ann: </font color="#00008B"> They have to learn right from wrong of course. But beating them is not the right way to do it<p>
<font color="#00008B">Heather: </font color="#00008B"> It is cowardly and taking the easy way out<p>
<font color="#00008B">Ronnie: </font color="#00008B"> What do you mean? Taking the easy way out?<p>
<font color="#00008B">Jean: </font color="#00008B"> It's too easy isn't it? Whacking the child? Far more difficult to administer an effective punishment from which the child could learn<p>
<font color="#00008B">Jamie:</font color="#00008B">  I learned something when I got caned â€“ I learned not to do it again<p>
<font color="#00008B">Heather: </font color="#00008B"> Really?? You never did anything again that you got caned for?<p>
<font color="#00008B">Jamie:</font color="#00008B">  (hesitantly) Well, I might have done<p>
<font color="#00008B">Jean: </font color="#00008B"> Exactly, so you didn't learn from that caning<p>
<font color="#00008B">Ann: </font color="#00008B"> I don't think anyone ever learned anything from it apart from how to be violent<p>
<font color="#00008B">Ronnie:</font color="#00008B">  That's nonsense. I was caned a few times and it never turned me into a violent person<p>
<font color="#00008B">Jean: </font color="#00008B"> Are you sure about that Ronnie? Because I seemed to remember your wife telling me that you had a fight at the pub a couple of years ago and lost two front teeth?<p>
<font color="#00008B">Ronnie: </font color="#00008B"> That's different. It wasn't my fault<p>
<font color="#00008B">Ann: </font color="#00008B"> That's not what I heard<p>
<font color="#00008B">Heather:</font color="#00008B">  It doesn't really matter who's fault. It is still violence<p>
<font color="#00008B">Miss Chase: </font color="#00008B"> Ahem. Children, children  -  oops sorry. I mean parents, parents, let us calm down. I realise this was getting a little heated, but you achieved my goal â€“ you had a debate<p>
<font color="#00008B">Ronnie: </font color="#00008B"> Oh yes, I suppose we did really<p>
<font color="#00008B">Jamie: </font color="#00008B"> Opposing views<p>
<font color="#00008B">Anne:</font color="#00008B">  Sounded more like an argument to me<p>
<font color="#00008B">Jean:</font color="#00008B">  I guess it is a thin line between argument and debate<p>
<font color="#00008B">Heather:</font color="#00008B">  I felt we made the better point though<p>
<font color="#00008B">Miss Chase:</font color="#00008B">  Everyone in a debate feels they made the better point â€“ otherwise there would be no debate. Everyone would just agree<p>
<font color="#00008B">Ronnie:</font color="#00008B">  Like the debate we had about movies?<p>
<font color="#00008B">Miss Chase:</font color="#00008B">  Precisely â€“ So it is now time to bring this class to an end. I would like to sincerely thank you all for your cooperation and I would like to ask if you have learned anything from this session?<p>
<font color="#00008B">Everyone:</font color="#00008B">  YES!!!! We don't want to go back to school<p>
<font color="#00008B">Miss Chase: </font color="#00008B"> I think that can be arranged â€“ goodnight everyone<p>
